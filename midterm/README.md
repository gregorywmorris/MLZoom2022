## Problem Statement

### By the Numbers

**Global:** Strokes are a global epidemic. They are the second leading cause of death and have increased by 70% between 1990 to 2019, with death from strokes  inceasing by 43% (source). The WHO estimates the anual cost of strokes to be over US$721 billion (source).

**United State:** While strokes have been declining for decades in the US, it still has a large financial burden, amounting to $53 billion anually (source). Currently stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the US (source).

## Optimal Outcomes

**Model Goal:** To predict stroke likely patients.

**Global:** Predicting stroke can provide an opportunity to take corrective actions before a stroke occurs. Most importantly, resulting in fewer deaths and disabilities.

Addtionally, the money lost to strokes would boost econamies. Assuming cost and stroke occurance are linear, if strokes were reduced by just 5%, that would inject $36 billion into world economies.

**United State:** And $2.65 billion into the US econamy.

## notebook.ipynb

The notebook has been optimized for Google Colab, there is a link at the top to open in directly in Google Colab without having to download and run locally.

**On Colab:** at the top select Runtime, then Run All. A popup will appear, select Run Anyways. This will ensure you do not miss any cell dependacies. 
Throughout this notebook you will find links to further understadning of various concepts. Data Science requires a knowleage of the subject matter to make the best descisions, such as exploring new features like diabetes and obesity that can be determined from the existing data.

Dataprep may fail (though appears resolved recently) and give the error: `TypeError: Callbacks must be either Callback or tuple`, this means the kernal needs to be restarted, see below.

**!pip:** 
Check !pip for alerts stating the kernal needs to restart. If you see this alert, just click `Restart Runtime` button provided by the error. This is an issue with Google colab and `!pip install dask is the culprit. Click Yes on the popup and then go ahead and run all again.

**Notebook Index** is your guide to exploring the notebook and has links to different sections.
