## Problem Statement

### By the Numbers

**Global:** Strokes are a global epidemic. They are the second leading cause of death and have increased by 70% between 1990 to 2019, with death from strokes  inceasing by 43% (source). The WHO estimates the anual cost of strokes to be over US$721 billion (source).

**United State:** While strokes have been declining for decades in the US, it still has a large financial burden, amounting to $53 billion anually (source). Currently stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the US (source).

## Optimal Outcomes

**Global:** Predicting stroke can provide an opportunity to take corrective actions before a stroke occurs. Most importantly, resulting in fewer deaths and disabilities.

Addtionally, the money lost to strokes would boost econamies. Assuming cost and stroke occurance are linear, if strokes were reduced by just 5%, that would inject $36 billion into world economies.

**United State:** And $2.65 billion into the US econamy.

The notebook has been optimized for Google Colab, there is a link at the top to open in directly in Google Colab without having to download and run locally. 

**!pip** 
Before you run all, run ipip and check for alerts stating the kernal needs to restart. If you see this alert, just click restart kernal. This is an issue with Google coalb and occurs occasionally. Dataprep will give an error (about a tuple) and is your indicator that this needs to be done. !pip install dask==2022.02.0 is the usual culprit.

Next, run all. This will ensure you do not miss any cell dependacies.
